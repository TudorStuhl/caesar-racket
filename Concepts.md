# What is included?
* higher-order functions (function composition)
* recursion
* lambda functions
* curried functions (unary functions that take multiple arguments but only one at a time)
* functors (wrapping a value into a context and allowing mapping over this value (mapping: applying a funtion to a value to get another value))
  * more specifically some monads, since the map will be applied and the context then removed
* type lifting (wrap a value inside some context)
